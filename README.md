# ZOOM-TG-BOT

Telegram bot for simplifying the creation of conferences in zoom. You need to select the date, start time and duration, after which the bot will automatically create a zoom conference on one of your accounts. When forming a keyboard for choosing the start time and duration, it selects only free time slots, that is, the created conferences do not overlap with each other.
